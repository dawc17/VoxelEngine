# Engine

Voxel chunk playground built with modern OpenGL 4.6. Renders greedy-meshed 16x16x16 chunks using a 2D texture array sliced from `assets/textures/blocks.png` (32x32 tiles) and overlays ImGui debug stats. GLAD, ImGui, and GLM are vendored under `libs/`. Since the last README update the engine picked up a full player controller, block palette, multi-layer chunk streaming, terrain gen with trees, and basic skylight.

## Note about AI Usage
This readme was generated using AI. AI was also used for debugging when the developer was in absolute despair and could not for his life
figure out what the hell an euler angle was or how exactly physics work. I hope you understand. Other than that, the code is 80% human effort.

## Features
- Streams a 5x5x5 column of chunks around the player, rebuilds greedy-meshed VBO/EBOs on demand, and uploads sky-lit vertices.
- Procedural FBM terrain with stone/dirt/grass/sand strata plus tree decorator that places log + leaf volumes pulled from the 32x32 tile atlas.
- Texture atlas loader turns `assets/textures/blocks.png` into a 2D texture array with mipmaps and full-anisotropy sampling.
- Player entity with AABB collisions, gravity, jumping, noclip toggle, and a configurable move speed; centered crosshair aids aiming.
- Raycast selection outline drives a block palette (dirt, grass, stone, sand, oak log, oak leaves); LMB breaks blocks, RMB places the currently selected block while avoiding the player volume.
- ImGui debug window shows FPS, camera position/orientation, velocity, chunk coords, currently hovered block, block palette selection, wireframe toggle, noclip toggle, and move-speed slider.

## Prerequisites
- CMake 3.14+
- C++17 compiler and OpenGL 4.6 capable GPU/drivers
- GLFW development package (or enable `-DGLFW_FETCH=ON` to fetch/build it; defaults to ON on Windows, OFF elsewhere)
- Linux packages (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install build-essential cmake libglfw3-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev`

## Build
```bash
cmake -B build -S . [-DGLFW_FETCH=ON]
cmake --build build       # produces build/src/VoxelEngine
```
Pass `-DGLFW_FETCH=ON` if you want CMake to fetch/build GLFW (useful on Windows or when a system package is unavailable).

### Windows (VS2022 Build Tools)
```powershell
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DGLFW_FETCH=ON .
cmake --build build --config Release
build\src\Release\VoxelEngine.exe
```
If you already have GLFW installed, set `-DGLFW_FETCH=OFF` and ensure CMake can find `glfw3`.

## Run
```bash
./build/src/VoxelEngine
```
- Release builds on Windows land at `build\src\Release\VoxelEngine.exe`; Debug builds live in `build\src\Debug\VoxelEngine.exe`.
- Shaders and assets are automatically copied to the build output directory.

## Distribution
The `build/src/Release/` folder is self-contained and ready to distribute:
```
Release/
├── VoxelEngine.exe
├── shaders/
│   ├── default.vert
│   ├── default.frag
│   ├── selection.vert
│   └── selection.frag
└── assets/
    └── textures/
        └── blocks.png
```
Zip up the `Release/` folder and share it. Saves will be created in a `saves/` folder next to the executable.

## Controls
- `W/A/S/D`: walk/fly the player depending on noclip state
- Mouse: look around (cursor locked by default)
- `Space`: jump (or move up while noclip is enabled)
- `Left Shift`: move down while noclip is enabled
- Mouse wheel: cycle the placeable block palette (dirt, grass, stone, sand, oak log, oak leaves)
- `LMB`: break the targeted block
- `RMB`: place the selected block on the hit face (skips if it would intersect the player)
- `U`: toggle cursor lock/unlock (re-centers on lock)
- `Esc`: close the window
- ImGui debug window: wireframe toggle, noclip toggle, camera speed slider, FPS/camera/chunk/block readouts

## Project Layout
- `src/main.cpp`: main loop, chunk streaming, texture array setup, ImGui wiring, raycast selection
- `src/Chunk*`, `Meshing.*`, `BlockTypes.*`: chunk storage, greedy meshing, block/atlas mapping
- `src/Player.*`, `Raycast.*`: player physics (AABB, gravity, noclip) plus block hit testing and placement helpers
- `src/ShaderClass.*`, `VBO.*`, `VAO.*`, `EBO.*`: OpenGL helpers
- `src/selection.vert/.frag`: thin shader used for the wireframe highlight
- `assets/textures/`: atlas (`blocks.png`) and reference textures

## Troubleshooting
- Texture/shader not found: run from the repo root or `build/` so relative paths resolve; ensure `assets/textures/blocks.png` and `src/default.vert/.frag` exist.
- GLFW link errors: install the GLFW dev package (or enable `-DGLFW_FETCH=ON` to build it locally).
